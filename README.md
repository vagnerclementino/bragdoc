A tool to create a document for bragging about achievements.

## Motivation

### Why Bragdoc?

Bragdoc is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help
individuals build their own "Brag Documents." The idea behind this tool stems
from a growing recognition of the importance of self-promotion and professional
self-awareness in today's competitive job market.

Inspired by insightful articles such as:

- [Brag Documents: A Secret Weapon for Your Career](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/) by Julia Evans
- [The Brag Document: How To Successfully Showcase Your Achievements](https://eltonminetto.dev/post/2022-04-14-brag-document/) by Elton Minetto
- [Hype Yourself, You're Worth It](https://aashni.me/blog/hype-yourself-youre-worth-it/) by Aashni Shah

We recognized the need for a simple, yet powerful tool to assist individuals in
tracking and presenting their professional achievements. Bragdoc was born out
of this need, and its name, "bragdoc", encapsulates its purpose: helping you
document your accomplishments and create a powerful resource to refer to during
performance reviews.
